This is a minimalist leaderboard system developed for simple Unity games. While it currently works as intended, I plan to improve and expand it over time. The code will be refactored into an interface-based structure to better follow SOLID principles and improve flexibility. I'm aware of its current limitations, such as tight coupling and lack of edge case handling, and I intend to address these in future updates. Additional improvements like handling duplicate scores, disconnected players, and integrating backend support are also planned.
